# Hi, and welcome ðŸ‘‹

It' nice to have you here, please feel at home to look around and hopefully you'll find yourself something useful.

## My name is **Felix Otoo**
I am a young vibrant young man living in the Ghana, on the Western part of the African continent.
A on a regular day, you will catch me writing lines of code to bring to live ideas and concepts.
I love technology and spend most of my time, working on software solutions that drives values and changes the way people do things.

I love music too, and my favourit genres are LoFi Music, Contemporary Gospel, and some cherry-picked Pop.

On the occassions, I'm not building software, or listneing to music, you will catch me writing articles for my personal blog and other online platforms like **Medium**, **Dev.to**.
