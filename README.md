# Hi, and welcome ðŸ‘‹

It's nice to have you here, do feel at home to look around and hopefully you'll find yourself something useful.

## About Me
My name is **Felix**. I'm a passion and vibrant young man living and working from Ghana, a cultural rich and hispital country on the Western part of the African continent. On a regular day, you will catch me with my head buried in my latop, coding away to some nice music, turning abstract ideas and concepts into concret solutions with each line of code. 

When I'm not writing code and listening to music, you'll much likely find me writing content for my blog site, and other platforms like [**Medium**](https://ofelix03.medium.com/). [**Dev.to**](https://dev.to/ofelix03).
