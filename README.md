### Hi there 👋

Welcome, and feel at home 


## Who am I ?
I am a young vibrant young man living in the Ghana, on the Western part of the African continent.
A on a regular day, you will catch me writing lines of code to bring to live ideas and concepts.
I love technology and spend most of my time, working on software solutions that drives values and changes the way people do things.

I love music too, and my favourit genres are LoFi Music, Contemporary Gospel, and some cherry-picked Pop.

On the occassions, I'm not building software, or listneing to music, you will catch me writing articles for my personal blog and other online platforms like **Medium**, **Dev.to**.
